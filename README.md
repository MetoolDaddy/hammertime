# Hammertime Panel

Companion for your vanilla server

Currently allows for : 

	- Caps protection
	- Player movement warning broadcasting to server operators
	- Simple callvote for permitted players
	- Word filter - both whole word and part of word detection
	- IP tracking - notification when IPs of 2 players match

This is still a work in progress.
